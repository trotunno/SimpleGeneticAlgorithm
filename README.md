# Simple Genetic Algorithm
A python script that simulates a population evolving over multiple generations according to a simple fitness function. Matplotlib is
used to display a few data points that are worth seeing.

Parameters:

*  𝑙, the length of the binary string of “genes” 
*  𝑁, the number of individuals in the population 
*  𝐺, the number of generations 
*  𝑝𝑚, the probability of a mutation occurring in one of the genes upon reproduction 
*  𝑝𝑐, the probability of two parents crossing their genes upon reproduction 

These are globals listed at the beginning of the script. Feel free to change them, and read the report included in the repository
to see what the fitness functino is and how changing the parameters can affect the outcome!
